- Database query languages provide interfaces for organizing and querying data. 
- There are two types of databases: relational databases and non-relational databases. One subcategory of non-relational databases, object-oriented databases, is what will be most familiar if you haven't learned much about databases yet and are coming from an object-oriented programming background.
- In object-oriented databases, the data structures ("objects") contain fields and other objects. Thus, data is hierarchically organized in object-oriented databases.
- In relational databases, which are probably less familiar to the beginner, the data structures ("tables") contain columns, and references to other tables are encoded in *foreign key columns*, which reference values in those other tables' *primary key columns*. In contrast to the hierarchical organization of data in object-oriented databases, one might say that data is "flatly" organized in relational databases.
- Relational database concepts are backed by the mathematics of relational algebra. Query optimization is therefore more mathematically tractable for relational databases than it is for non-relational databases and object-oriented databases.
- Likely because of this, the SQL (for "structured query language") database and query language specification has dominated database technology since the early days of databases.
- Nowadays, there are some non-relational "NoSQL" databases becoming more popular. (The fact that "NoSQL" is conflated with non-relational, which has the (untrue) implication that all relational databases are SQL, belies how dominant SQL has been and is.) Unfortunately for the object-orientation lover, object-oriented databases are not one of the types of non-relational/NoSQL databases gaining popularity. The ones gaining traction are "document databases" that store documents (object literals) in JSON. These are still pretty close in spirit to true object-orientation. The main difference is that document databases store self-contained object literals rather than object references, so a single document might contain a large hierarchy of nested objects.
