A quick overview of containers and container images:

- A *container config file* is a sequence of OS-agnostic commands that can be translated by a piece of software called a *container engine* into the appropriate sequence of OS-particular commands. (Container config files for the popular container engine Docker are called "Dockerfiles". Docker is so popular that most open source container software still uses the Dockerfile format for container config files.)
- A *container image* is the pre-assembled result of running the OS-particular commands specified in a container config file that is put together by a container engine. A running instance of a container image is called a *container*.
- **The power of containers is that container config files give a platform-agnostic interface to describing pre-assembled results.** When you use a container engine to such as Docker to pull a container image from an online repository, Docker makes sure to give you a version of the image that is configured for your OS.
- A container image that is the pre-assembled result of setting up a dev environment (by running various package install commands, DB config commands, app sever config commands, etc.) can be very useful for sharing a particular dev environment with others. To share the dev environment, just share the container config file! All that one who has the container config file has to do to set up the dev environment is install a container engine, and then tell the engine to build a container image from the config file.
  - Note: with these dev container images, it's a matter of choice as to whether or not the container image includes the step of starting the dev servers. Most dev container images do have the start of the dev servers built into the image.
