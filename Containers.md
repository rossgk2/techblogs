A quick overview of containers and container images:

- A *container image* is the pre-assembled result, configured to run on a particular OS, of a sequence of OS-agnostic commands that can be translated by a *container engine* into the appropriate sequence of OS-particular commands. A file detailing a sequence of such OS-agnostic commands is called a *container config file*. (Container config files for the popular container engine Docker are called "Dockerfiles"). A running instance of a container image is called a *container*.
- When you use a container engine to such as Docker to pull a container image from an online repository, Docker makes sure to give you a version of the image that is configured for your OS.
- The power of containers is that container config files give a platform-agnostic interface to describing pre-assembled results.
- A container image that is the pre-assembled result of setting up a dev environment (by running various package install commands, DB config commands, app sever config commands, etc.) can be very useful for sharing a particular dev environment with others. To share the dev environment, just share the container config file! All that one who has the container config file has to do to set up the dev environment is install a container engine (probably Docker), and then tell the engine to run the config file.
  - Note: with these dev container images, it's a matter of choice as to whether or not the container image includes the step of starting the dev servers. Most dev container images do have the start of the dev servers built into the image.
